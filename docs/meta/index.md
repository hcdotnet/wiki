# Meta Documentation

This is the documentation for the wiki, its purpose, and how to contribute.

If you wound up here by mistake and are looking for the actual wiki, you can find it [here](/docs/games/holocure.md).

## About

The HoloCure Wiki is a community-driven, free, and open-source project.

See more [here](/docs/meta/about.md).

## Contributing

Since this wiki is entirely community-driven, we rely on the goodwill contributions of players to keep it up-to-date and relevant.

If you would like to contribute, please see the [contributing guide](/docs/meta/contributing.md).
